title: 'CS 5914 Human-AI Interaction Powered by LLMs'
---

### Course Description

This course will introduce students to ways of thinking about how recent developments in AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) shape everyday life and how to design such systems in a manner that can respect human values.

### Format

This course is a lecture-based course including interactive discussions and a final project. For the final project, students will form interdisciplinary groups of 2-3 members and will create an innovative Human-AI interaction system powered by LLMs (students can also use other deep learning architectures and modalities of their choice beyond text, including vision and audio, but will need to confirm with the instructor in advance). The system can be chosen from a variety of those discussed throughout the course. In the past, student final projects have included counterspeech generators powered by LLMs, an interactive sign-language learning system, and an image generating tool for food and menu design using prompts.

**This is a highly interactive class:** You’ll be expected to actively participate in activities, projects, assignments, and discussions.

This course will introduce students to ways of thinking about how recent developments in AI systems powered by large language models will shape everyday life and how to design such systems in manner that can respect human values. Students will read and discuss papers in Human-AI interaction powered by language models, including but not limited to: 
- (1) Human-AI interactive systems powered by LLMs that work / clash with the strengths and weaknesses of human cognition, 
- (2) Designing interactive, human-in-the-loop approaches in such systems, and 
- (3) Supporting interpretability, transparency, trust, and fairness in AI tools supported by LLMs.   

These topics will be explored in the context of real-world applications (e.g., For Some Autistic People, ChatGPT Is a LifelineLinks to an external site.), through which students will learn how to think both optimistically and critically of what LLM-powered AI systems can do, and how they can and should be integrated into society.

### Prequisites

At the minimum, students should have an intermediate proficiency in python programming. A basic knowledge of deep / machine learning, statistics, and prior coursework in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are a plus, but not required. This course will include in-class LLM tutorial sessions designed to help you with your course project.
