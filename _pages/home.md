    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I lead the <a href='/sail'>SAIL (Society + AI & Language) Lab</a>. My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My work aims to advance Computational Social Science by using computational linguistics to better understand how AI-mediated systems impact interactions across people and machines.
