The Society + AI & Language (SAIL) Lab at Virginia Tech is led by [Dr. Eugenia H. Rho](https://eugeniarho.com/).

At SAIL, we strive to advance Computational Social Science (CSS) by using **AI** and **computational linguistics** to better understand how AI-mediated systems impact interactions across people and machines.

Our mission at SAIL is to design more inclusive and effective AI systems that positively impact society. To achieve this we leverage our expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to bridge the gap between the technical and social aspects of computer science. We use computational linguistics and experimental design to analyze large-scale data and develop insights into the complex interactions across people and machines, with a particular focus on understanding the social implications of these systems.

## To Prospective Students

SAIL Lab is always looking for PhD students and exceptional master and undergraduate students. Please apply to [CS@VT](https://cs.vt.edu/). If you are in Virginia Tech already and would like to work with us, please reach out to [eugenia@vt.edu](https://sail.cs.vt.edu/eugenia@vt.edu).
